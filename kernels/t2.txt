Mason Benson, former president and
chief operating officer of Empire of Carolina Inc, a toy maker,
today was sentenced in Manhattan federal court to a year and
one day in jail for his involvement in a kickback scheme.
    Benson pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, tax
evasion, filing false corporate tax returns and defrauding the
company's shareholders. He was also fined 5,000 dlrs.
    Benson was charged with demanding kickbacks from sales
representatives who were asked to turn over a portion of their
commisisons as a condition for doing business with Empire.
 ReuterInco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the company's stock.
    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
