<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills
maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would
drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers'
balances would take out a further 140 mln.
    Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345
mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be
an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SETS MONEY MARKET TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said it invited offers
of first category paper today for a money market intervention
tender.
    Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the
Bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter
percentage point to 7-3/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing
in call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness
on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency
stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.
    Intervention rate was last raised to eight pct from 7-1/4
on January 2. Call money today was quoted at 7-11/16 7-3/4 pct.
