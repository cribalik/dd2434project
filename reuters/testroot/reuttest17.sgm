<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
world economic growth.ï¿½&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.

    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but
stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was "very important."
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."
    "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified," he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan
bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.
    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"
Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
determine the appropriate size of provisions.
    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to
push further."

plans if it succeeds in its 5.2 billion-dlr takeover of Dome
Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP> will be worth more than one billion
Canadian dlrs, a published report said.
    Public stockholders would own at least 15 pct of Amoco
Canada, although Amoco plans to raise the level of Canadian
participation higher than that, Amoco Canada president Donald
Stacy said in an interview in the Toronto Star.
    Stacy would not say how much higher, adding that that
question will be the subject of discussions between Amoco and
Investment Canada, the federal agency which reviews foreign
takeovers of Canadian companies, the newspaper said.
   
    Amoco Canada plans to make its submission to the agency
next Thursday.
    Stacy said the issue would be sold in stages and that the
first stage would be worth 200 mln to 300 mln Canadian dlrs,
the Star said. The initial offering would not take place until
at least one year after Amoco acquired Dome, to allow the two
operations to merge.

<TITLE>CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Skinner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with
its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
&lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
bid.
    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.

    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds
just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
had told CSR it is not a seller.
    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.

    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
describing it as a long term investment.
    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
    "We fit better with Monier," he said.
    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
into energy several years ago.
    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
said: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
wonder if Monier is the main target."

    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.

    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
negotiations foundered on the price.
    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of
&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

<TITLE>AFRICAN BANK OFFICIAL CONFIDENT ON LOAN REPAYMENTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Secretary-General of the African
Development Bank expressed confidence in the institution's
ability to handle potential problems with repayment of
development financing loans.
    Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank's
headquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs at
present, a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceeded
one billion dlrs in 1986.
    Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinary
measures to deal with third world lending strategies.
    "We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time,"
Dei-Anang said. But he denied than any ADB loan arrears were
more than 12 months behind schedule.
    "We have never had a default. We have never written off a
loan," he added.
    Dei-Anang said the Abidjan-based ADB will hold its annual
general meeting in Cairo from June 9 to June 11 and over 1,000
delegates were expected to attend.
    The agenda will include the approval of the bank's annual
report and accounts, but there will be no debate on the capital
increase which is currently being voted on by the ADB
governors.
    An ADB spokeswoman said the U.S. Had voted for a 200 pct
increase in the bank's capital, but other votes were still
coming in.
    In December, an ad-hoc committee of the ADB's board of
governors, comprising 18 African and non-African countries,
agreed that a 200 pct increase was necessary to finance a rise
in lending between 1987 and 1991.
    If the recommendations are approved by the board, the
capital of the bank would rise from around 6.55 billion dlrs to
19.66 billion dlrs.
    Dei-Anang said the capital increase would help the bank
improve its borrowing capacity. "The capital increase is in
effect a passport to the capital market," he said.
    "It will enable us to borrow something like 4.5 billion dlrs
in the next five years," he added.

Association> said it has signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired by &lt;Montrose Holding Co>, an affiliate of &lt;Montrose
Capital Corp> for 20 mln dlrs.
    Virginia Federal and Montrose Capital said the agreement
provides for the conversion of Virginia Federal from a mutual
to a stock association and the purchase of 100 pct of its stock
for 20 mln dlrs by Montrose.
    According to the companies, Virginia Federal has over 700
mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in Virginia.
    Virginia Federal said the proceeds would enable it to
provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the
company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market.
    The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home
Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year.
    Additionally, the companies said the converted association
would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six
current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of
Montrose Holding.
    The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to
continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.

<TITLE>BELL CANADA PLANS LONG DISTANCE TOLL CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bell Canada, a unit of Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc &lt;BCE>, said it applied for an average eight pct
cut in Canadian long distance rates.
    The application to the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission would also reduce the initial
period for operated-assisted calls from three minutes to one
minute and operator- and customer-dialed calls would be charged
the same.
    The billing of operator-assisted calls would include a
conection charge, however. The new rate structure is similar to
schedules announced by Bell January 1 for calls within Ontario,
Quebec and parts of the Northwest Territories, it said.
